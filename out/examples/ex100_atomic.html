Some applications are inherently non-deterministic and require the deterministic property of C&eacute;u to be relaxed.
 (That's why the static analysis raises a warning instead of an error.)

<p>
In these situations, C&eacute;u ensures that concurrent trails accessing the 
same variables each execute atomically, i.e., they are never interrupted.
</p>

<p>
In the example, lines 6 and 13 run concurrently.
However, C&eacute;u either completely executes <code>v=v+1</code> or 
<code>v=v*2</code>.
