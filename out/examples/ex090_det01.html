<p>
C&eacute;u is designed to be <span class="label label-info">deterministic</span>
in the sense that a given program, when executed multiple times, should always 
yield the same outcome when the same sequence of input events is repeated.
</p>

<!--
<p>
However, as trails share variables, it is easy to write non-deterministic 
programs.
</p>
-->

<p>
In this example, even though the variable <code>v</code> is accessed
"concurrently" in the trails in parallel awaking to <code>A</code>, the
execution is still deterministic.

<!--
<p>
When running the program, read the message in the <span class="label 
label-info">Debug</span> output.
</p>
-->

<p>
The scheduler of Céu always executes the trails in the order they appear in the
program.

<!--
Even though the compiler warns about the suspicious accesses to <code>v</code>, 
the scheduler of Céu always awakes the trail that appears first in the program 
text.
-->

<p>
This way, the first trail awakes first, assigns <code>1</code> and halts;
then the second trail awakes and assigns <code>2</code>.
The final result is always <code>2</code>.
