<span class="label label-info">Internal events</span> are used as a signaling mechanism among trails.
</p>

<p>
A program can <code>await</code> for changes on internal events, 
which can be signaled through the <code>emit</code> statement.
</p>

<p>
The emitted value can be captured by the corresponding awaiting trails.
</p>

<!--
<p>
You can also think of internal events as a kind of <span class="label 
label-info">reactive variables</label>.
