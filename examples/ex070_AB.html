The existence of a parallel statement raises several questions regarding how trails 
scheduled during execution. Nonetheless, the concurrency properties of C&eacute;u are 
quite simple and easy to grasp.
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><i>C&eacute;u doesn't require semaphores, locks, or any other synchronization primitive!</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some rules are respected during the execution of programs, the first of which 
is the <span class="label label-info">synchronous execution model</span>.
</p>

<p>
A running program in C&eacute;u is <i>synchronous</i> with respect to input 
events.
This means that while trails are reacting to the current input event, no 
further events are handled in any other trail.
</p>

<p>
The period in which trails are reacting to a given input event is named as a 
<span class="label label-info">reaction chain</span>.  A trail only halts (i.e. 
stops to react) when it awaits again or terminates.
</p>

<p>
In the example, suppose the event <code>A</code> occurs just before 
<code>B</code>.
</p>

<p>
Initially, both trails in parallel are awaiting, and the occurrence of 
<code>A</code> awakes the first trail that performs the increment on 
<code>v</code>.
</p>

<p>
If the event B occurs during the increment operation, it is enqueued by the 
C&eacute;u runtime until the running reaction chain terminates to respect the 
synchronous execution model.
</p>

<p>
This way, there is no possible race condition on accessing <code>v</code> and, 
given the sequence <code>A-&gt;B</code>, the only possible result for the 
program is <code>2</code> ((0+1)*2).
</p>

<p>
Try also to invert the emits in the <span class="label label-info">Input</span> 
panel and observe the output.
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><i>Reactions to input events do not overlap.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But what if a trail executes endlessly and never halts, 
how further input events could be handled?
</p>

<p>
And what if multiple trails react to the same input event and access the same variables?
</p>
