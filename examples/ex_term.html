We can change the original <code>par/and</code> example to terminate on the occurrence of the input event <code>TERM</code>. 
We just need to enclose the whole code with another <code>par/or</code> that awaits the termination event in parallel.

<p>Note that we don't need to change a single line in the original par/and loop.</p>
