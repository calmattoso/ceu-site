C&eacute;u is designed to be <span class="label label-info">deterministic</span>
 in the sense that a given program should always yield the same outcome for the
 same sequence of input events executed multiple times.
</p>

However, as trails share variables, it is easy to write non-deterministic 
programs.

<p>
 In this example, the variable <code>v</code> is accessed 
concurrently on the occurrence of <code>A</code>.
