C&eacute;u is designed to be <span class="label label-info">deterministic</span>
in the sense that a given program, when executed multiple times, should always 
yield the same outcome when the same sequence of input events is repeated.
</p>

<p>
However, as trails share variables, it is easy to write non-deterministic 
programs.
</p>

<p>
In this example, the variable <code>v</code> is accessed concurrently on the 
occurrence of <code>A</code>.

Before running the program, click the <span class="label label-info">static 
analysis</span> checkbox and read the message in the <span class="label 
label-info">Debug</span> output.
