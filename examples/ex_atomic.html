Some applications are inherently non-deterministic and require the deterministic property of C&eacute;u to be relaxed.
 (That's why the static analysis raises a warning instead of an error.)

For these situations, C&eacute;u ensures that the concurrent trails' segments that access 
the same variables execute atomically, i.e., they are never interrupted.
