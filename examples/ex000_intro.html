<p>
This is the online tutorial for the <a href="index.html">C&eacute;u programming 
language</a>.

<p>
We assume some knowledge in C, as most of the basic functionality 
of C&eacute;u derives from it (constants, operators, declarations, etc).

<p>
You can navigate through the examples using the buttons
<span class="label label-info">Index</span>,
<span class="label label-info">&lt;</span>, and
<span class="label label-info">&gt;</span> on top of page.

<p>
Feel free to modify the examples in the
<span class="label label-info">Code</span> panel at any time.

<p>
The <span class="label label-info">Input</span> panel is used to trigger events 
into the program.

<p>
To run a program, click the <span class="label label-info">Run</span> button on 
top-right of the page.
The results appear in the panel on bottom.

<p>
To advance to the next lesson, click the button <span class="label 
label-info">&gt;</span> above.
