If only a single line of execution were allowed, a program would not be allowed
to wait for multiple events at the same time.
Then, C&eacute;u would be the most worthless language in the World.

<p>
C&eacute;u provides parallel compositions to allow multiple lines of execution,
aka <span class="label label-info">trails</span>, to coexist and wait for
multiple events:

<ul>
    <li> a <code>par/and</code> stands for <i>parallel and</i> and rejoins
                                after all trails in parallel terminate
    <li> a <code>par/or</code>  stands for <i>parallel or</i> and rejoins
                                after any of the trails in parallel terminates,
                                aborting all others
    <li> a <code>par</code>     stands for <i>parallel</i> and never rejoins
</ul>
