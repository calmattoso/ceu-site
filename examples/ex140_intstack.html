<p>
A running trail that emits an internal event may cause another trail to awake.  
This way, we must specify how the communicating trails interact precisely.
</p>

<p>
In C&eacute;u, when a trail emits an internal event, it immediately halts, 
resuming only after the complete reaction to it terminates.
</p>

<p>
The way internal events execute is analogous to conventional call/return 
routines.
When a routine is invoked, the statement following it only executes after the 
routine returns.
Also, just like routines, internal events can nest to a deep level of emits.
