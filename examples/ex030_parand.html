<p>
If only a single line of execution were allowed, a program could not wait for 
multiple events at the same time, and C&eacute;u would be the most worthless 
language in the World.
</p>

<p>
A line of execution is known as a <span class="label label-info">trail</span>, 
and C&eacute;u allows multiple trails to coexist through parallel compositions.
</p>

<p>
C&eacute;u supports three kinds of parallel statements: <code>par/and</code>,   
<code>par/or</code>, and <code>par</code>.
They differ in how they rejoin the trails on termination.
</p>

<p>
The <code>par/and</code> stands for <i>parallel and</i>, meaning that the 
trails spawned in parallel rejoin after they both terminate.
</p>

<p>
In the example, after the <code>par/and</code> rejoins, the loop restarts, 
printing the "Hello World!" message continuously.
