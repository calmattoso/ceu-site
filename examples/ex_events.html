<p>C&eacute;u supports events that represent external input, allowing programs to interact with the environment.</p>

<blockquote>       
	<p><i>The <code>await</code> statement accounts for the reactive nature of C&eacute;u.</i></p>

<p> An input event in C&eacute;u represents a correspondent event in the underlying platform. 
The availability of external events depend on the platform in use. </p>

<p>
 For example, in an <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Arduino">Arduino</a> binding for C&eacute;u, a change in an input pin on the microcontroller
might trigger a correspondent input event in C&eacute;u. In higher-level platforms (e.g. operating systems),
more abstract events might be available, such as keyboard presses, or the arrival of network packets.
