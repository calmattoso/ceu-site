This is a reactive <i>Hello World!</i> in C&eacute;u which prints the infamous
message every 250 milliseconds:
   
<p>
The <code>await</code> statement halts the running line of execution until 
the specified event occurs (in this case, a 250 milliseconds timer).

<p>
In C&eacute;u, external C symbols like <code>printf</code> must be preceded 
with an <b>underscore</b>.
<!-- and predeclared in with a <code>C</code> statement.-->

<p>
In this tutorial, <code>printf</code> is predeclared and is the only available
function in C.

<p>
The <code>loop</code> statement in the example repeats its body indefinitely.

<p>
Note the <code>emit 1s</code> in the
<span class="label label-info">Input</span> panel.
Since the tutorial executes as a simulation in the server, we need to provide
all input to the program.

The <code>loop</code> statement in the example repeats its body indefinitely.
