<p>
Conversely, a <code>par/or</code> rejoins after any spawned trail in parallel 
terminates, killing the other.
</p>

<p>
If we change the <code>par/and</code> from the previous example to a 
<code>par/or</code>, the second <code>_printf</code> is never reached.
</p>

<p>
The <code>await 100ms</code> in the first trail always awakes first and rejoins 
the <code>par/or</code>, killing the <code>await 250ms</code> in the second 
trail to restart the loop.

<!--
<p>
Try also to run the program with the <span class="label label-info">static 
analysis</span> checkbox to see the warning complaining that the 
<code>await</code> in line 6 is unreachable.
