<i>Asyncs</i> are allowed to trigger input events and the passage of time towards the synchronous side of a program,
 providing a way to test programs in the own language.
</p>
 
<p>
In this example, we use a <code>par</code> to execute the program to be tested 
(i.e. <i>the original code</i>) together with the input simulation.
As synchronous code has higher priority, the program immediately awaits event 
<code>A</code>.
Then, the <code>async</code> emits event <code>A</code>, awaking the 
synchronous code, which enters the loop, prints the message, and awaits 
<code>10ms</code>.
Then, the <code>async</code> resumes and emits <code>1s35ms</code>, what makes 
the synchronous side to resume, increment <code>v</code>, restart the loop, 
print the message, and await <code>10ms</code> again.
However, <code>1s25ms</code> remains from the previous <code>emit</code>, what 
makes the synchronous side to resume again, and again (the loop iterates and 
prints the message exactly 103 times).
