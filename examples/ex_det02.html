<p>
C&eacute;u performs a <span class="label label-info">static analysis</span> to detect 
non-deterministic access to variables, raising a warning if it is the case.
</p>

<p>
Note in this example that, although both trails access <code>v</code> on the 
occurrence of <code>A</code>, they can never happen at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The static analysis correctly identifies this example as deterministic and does 
not raise a warning.
