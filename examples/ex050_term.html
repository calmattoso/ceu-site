We can change the <code>par/and</code> example of <a 
href="try.php?sample=ex_parand">lesson 5</a> to terminate on the first
occurrence of the input event <code>TERM</code>.

<p>
Now, we just need to enclose the whole code with a <code>par/or</code> to await
the termination event in parallel.

<p>
Note that we don't need to change a single line in the original 
<code>par/and</code> loop.
