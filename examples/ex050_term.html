<p>
We can change the <code>par/and</code> example of <a 
href="try.php?sample=ex_parand">lesson 4</a> to terminate on the occurrence of 
the input event <code>TERM</code>.
</p>

<p>
We just need to enclose the whole code with a <code>par/or</code> to await the 
termination event in parallel.
</p>

<p>
Note that we don't need to change a single line in the original 
<code>par/and</code> loop.
