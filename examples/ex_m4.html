<p>
C&eacute;u source files can be optionally preprocessed with <a href="//www.gnu.org/software/m4/">m4</a>,
 which offers similar functionality to the C preprocessor.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, <span class="label label-info">m4</span> can be used to substitute arbitrary code, 
providing a powerful mechanism for creating <span class="label label-info">abstractions</span> in C&eacute;u.
</p>

<p>
This example defines the macro <code>AWAIT_COND</code> that loops until the value of an event satisfies a condition. 
The event name, condition operator, and expected value should be passed as arguments to the macro.
</p>
   
<p>
The two occurrences <code>AWAIT_COND</code> in the source code are expanded to the macro definition.
</p>

<p>
In <code>m4</code>, the command <code>define</code> is used to define a new macro. 
The symbols <code>`</code> and <code>'</code> are used to enclose tokens that contain spaces and special characters.
</p>

<p>
In C&eacute;u, the token <code>@</code> is ignored by the parser and is used to highlight the use of macros.
