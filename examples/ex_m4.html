<p>
C&eacute;u source files can be optionally preprocessed with <a 
 href="//www.gnu.org/software/m4/"><span class="label 
label-info">m4</span></a>, providing a similar functionality to the C 
preprocessor.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, <span class="label label-info">m4</span> can also be used to 
substitute blocks of code, providing a powerful mechanism for creating <span 
class="label label-info">abstractions</span> in C&eacute;u.
</p>

<p>
This example defines the macro <code>AWAIT_COND</code> that loops until the 
value of an event satisfies a condition.  The event name (<code>$1</code>), 
condition operator (<code>$2</code>), and expected value (<code>$3</code>) 
should be passed as arguments to the macro.
</p>
   
<p>
The two occurrences <code>AWAIT_COND</code> in the source code are expanded to the macro definition.
</p>

<p>
In <span class="label label-info">m4</span>, command <code>define</code> is 
used to define a new macro, and symbols <code>`</code> and <code>'</code> are 
used to enclose tokens that contain spaces and special characters.
</p>

<p>
In C&eacute;u, the token <code>@</code> is ignored by the parser and is used to 
highlight the use of a macro.
