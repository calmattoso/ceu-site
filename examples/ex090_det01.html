<p>
C&eacute;u is designed to be <span class="label label-info">deterministic</span>
in the sense that a given program, when executed multiple times, should always 
yield the same outcome when the same sequence of input events is repeated.
</p>

<p>
However, as trails share variables, it is easy to write non-deterministic 
programs.
</p>

<p>
In this example, the variable <code>v</code> is accessed concurrently on the 
occurrence of <code>A</code>.
</p>

<p>
When running the program, read the message in the <span class="label 
label-info">Debug</span> output.
</p>

Even though the compiler warns about the suspicious accesses to <code>v</code>, 
the scheduler of CÃ©u always awakes the trail that appears first in the program 
text.
This way, the first trails resumes, assigns <code>1</code> and halts;
then the second trail resumes and assigns <code>2</code>.
The final result is always <code>2</code>.
