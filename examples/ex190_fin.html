<p>

Some C functions produce a side effect that requires a further call to destroy 
that effect.
For example, a call to <code>malloc</code> will allocate memory that should be 
destroyed in the future.

In C&eacute;u, any variable that is assigned a pointer from a function call 
requires a finalization code.

<span class="label label-info">Internal events</span> are used as a signaling mechanism among trails.
</p>

<p>
A program can <code>await</code> for changes on internal events, 
which can be signaled through the <code>emit</code> statement.
</p>

<p>
The emitted value can be captured by the corresponding awaiting trails.

You can also think of internal events as a kind of <span class="label 
label-info">reactive variables</label>.
