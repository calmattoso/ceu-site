<p>
The previous <a href="try.php?sample=ex_tight">factorial example</a> contains a 
tight loop and should not be written that way.
</p>

<p>
C&eacute;u supports <span class="label label-info">asynchronous blocks</span> 
(asyncs) to perform time consuming computations requiring tight loops.
</p>

<p>
To ensure that synchronous code runs with higher priority, <code>async</code> 
blocks are suspended whenever there is a pending input event.
Note that you can never know if/when an <code>async</code> executes.
