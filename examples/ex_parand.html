<p>If only a single line of execution were allowed, a program could not wait for 
multiple events at the same time, and C&eacute;u would be the most worthless language in the World.</p>

<p>A line of execution is known as a <span class="label label-info">trail</span>, and C&eacute;u allows multiple trails to coexist.
The parallel statements of C&eacute;u (<code>par/and</code>,   <code>par/or</code>,   <code>par</code>) splits the running trail in two.</p>

<p>The <code>par/and</code> stands for <i>parallel and</i>, meaning that the trails spawned 
in parallel rejoin after both terminate (restarting the loop, in the example).</p>
